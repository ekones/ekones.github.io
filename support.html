    <h1>How to Play - Mathze Game</h1>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> The objective of the game is to select a combination of numbers and arithmetic operators (+ and -) to make the resulting sum equal to zero. As you progress through the levels, the board size increases, adding more complexity to the game.</p>

    <h2>Game Elements:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Board:</strong> The game board consists of a grid of numbered tiles and arithmetic operator tiles (+ and -).</li>
        <li><strong>Difficulty Levels:</strong> The game offers four difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert), which can be selected from a dropdown menu.</li>
        <li><strong>Controls:</strong> You can restart the game, move back to the previous level, or progress to the next level using the provided controls.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Play:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start the game by selecting a difficulty level from the dropdown menu.</li>
        <li>Observe the game board and plan your strategy to make the sum zero.</li>
        <li>Tap a number tile to select it. The selected number tile will change color.</li>
        <li>Tap an arithmetic operator (+ or -) tile to select it. The selected operator tile will change color.</li>
        <li>Tap another number tile to apply the selected operator. The sum will be calculated, and the new number will replace the second selected number tile. The first number tile and the operator tile will be marked as used and become unselectable.</li>
        <li>Continue to select number and operator tiles to reach the sum of zero. The game is won when all the remaining number tiles have a value of zero.</li>
        <li>If only one tile is left, and the board cannot be further modified, the game is lost.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Carefully plan your moves to avoid getting stuck with an unsolvable board.</li>
        <li>Keep an eye on the difficulty level; higher difficulty levels will introduce a larger range of numbers, making the game more challenging.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With this guide, you are now ready to test and improve your arithmetic skills in the Simple Math Game. Good luck, and have fun!</p>
